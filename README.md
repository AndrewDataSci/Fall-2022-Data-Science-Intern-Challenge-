# Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge 
 
 **The first challenge Q1 was addressed using Python and JupterLab. See "Challenge" Notebook for full report.**

**Conclusion and Business Recommendations:**

The dataset consisted of 5000 orders made by 301 users, the information is taken from 100 shops selling sneakers over a 30 day period in March 2017. The main focus is do some analysis of the average order value (AOV) and evaluate why the AOV of $3145.13 has been calculated knowing that these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item.

**Upon this analysis we have been able to conclude that:**

- The mean for order amount is $3145.13 as described in the problem statement. This is not due to incorrect data entry or duplicate data, but because there a large standard deviation associated with the data.
- The order amount ranges from $90 to $704000. The large maximum is explained by shop 42 which recieves regular orders of 2000 items which amounts to $704000.
- On observation of the data visualisation, the order amount data is significantly skewed to the right, therefore the mean is going to be larger than the median. We conclude that 75% of the order values are below approximately $390 and 25% of the order values are below approximately $160.
- What metric would you report for this dataset? Due to the large variation of the data from the mean I would use the median of the order amounts to evaluate the AOV.
- What is its value? the value of the median is $284.


**The second challenge Q2 was addressed using SQL on an online editor. See "SQL Challenge" PDF for queries and answers.**
